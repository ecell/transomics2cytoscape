# Version Information

**Bioconductor version**: `r BiocManager::version()`

**KEGGscape (Cytoscape app)**: 0.8.2

# Introduction

Visualization of transomic networks helps biological interpretation by
exhibiting where the signal goes [@gehlenborg_visualization_2010].

To understand transomics datasets, Yugi has proposed a method for network
visualization [@yugi_reconstruction_2014] by integrating multiple pathways
in 3D space.

The 3D network visualization was created by VANTED [@rohn_vanted_2012]
and manual operation.
transomics2cytoscape automatically creates the 3D network visualization with
Cytoscape [@shannon_cytoscape:_2003],
[Cy3D](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cy3d) renderer, and
Cytoscape Automation [@otasek_cytoscape_2019].

## Installation

This package requires [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) to be installed and
You need to run Cytoscape before running the following R code.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("ecell/transomics2cytoscape", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Workflow

There is a function `create3Dnetwork` in transomics2cytoscape.
In the ``create3Dnetwork`, the following workflow is executed.

![workflow_diagram](../man/figures/workflow_diagram.jpg)

This function takes the following 3 input files and visualizes a 3D network
in Cytoscape.

## Input files

### 1. A TSV file of network layers

A file that defines multiple networks to be layered in 3D space.
The format is as follows.

```
layer1  rno04910    600
layer2  galFiltered.sif 400
layer3  rno00010    200
layer4  rno00010    1
```

The first column is the network layer ID,
the second column is the KEGG pathway ID or an arbitrary network file,
and the last column is the Z height of the network.

### 2. A TSV file of transomic network edges between the network layers

A file that defines transomic interactions
(i.e., the edges that connect the different network layers).
The format is as follows.

```
layer1  rno:84006   layer2  YMR300C transomicsType1
layer2  YMR300C layer3  rno:100364062   transomicsType2
layer3  rno:100364062   layer4  rno:100364062   transomicsType3
```

The 1st and 2nd columns are the information about source node of
the transomic interaction.
The 3rd and 4th columns are about the target node.
The 2nd and 4th columns are the id of KEGG object or the name of
a node in an arbitrary network file.
The last column is the type of the transomic interaction.

### 3. A style file of Cytoscape

A Cytoscape style file.
For more information about Cytoscape style file, see the
[Cytoscape user manual](http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/Styles.html).
Note that you can only use style properties that are supported by Cy3D.

## Example

```{r setup}
# suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
# suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(RCy3))
# suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(KEGGREST))
# Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8") 
library(transomics2cytoscape)
sif <- system.file("extdata","galFiltered.sif",package="RCy3")
file.copy(sif, ".")
networkLayers <- system.file("extdata", "networkLayers.tsv",
    package = "transomics2cytoscape")
transomicEdges <- system.file("extdata", "transomicEdges.tsv",
    package = "transomics2cytoscape")
stylexml <- system.file("extdata", "transomics.xml",
    package = "transomics2cytoscape")
create3Dnetwork(networkLayers, transomicEdges, stylexml)
```

Then, you should have a 3D view with layered networks and transomic
interactions between them.
