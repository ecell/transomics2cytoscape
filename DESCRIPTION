Description: transomics2cytoscape generates a file for 3D transomics
    visualization by providing input that specifies the IDs of multiple
    KEGG pathway layers, their corresponding Z-axis heights, and an input that
    represents the edges between the pathway layers.
    The edges are used, for example, to describe the relationships between
    kinase on a pathway and enzyme on another pathway.
    This package automates creation of a transomics network as
    shown in the figure in Yugi.2014
    (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.07.021)
    using Cytoscape automation
    (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1758-4).
